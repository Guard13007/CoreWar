## The hell is this?

I copied a few programs and compiled pmars and started working on some of my own
programs. This is a collection of stuffs loosely organized.

The `pmars` files is a binary compiled on Elementary OS Freya. I assume it
should work on a Debian system with X11, but I'm not really sure.
